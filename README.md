# [Playground] Elsa Voice
Repository for working through different stages moving towards the elsa voice development. 
Ton of testing and work is expected to be put here regarding anything Elsa Voice (during its initial phase).

## Suggested structure

This is a simple example of how I think we should set up our items within the repo.
There can be atleast 1 jupyter notebook that has the stuff being developed for. 

Example:
```
(in this repo)
  - audio-preprocessing.ipynb
  - asr-nn-approach.ipynb
```

The 2 files should have the topmost cell explaining what the notebook is all about


## Go Crazy

That said, you can being by cloning the notebook and start working on the different tasks
