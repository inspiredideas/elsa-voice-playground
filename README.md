# [Playground] Elsa Voice
Repository for working through different stages moving towards the elsa voice development. 
Ton of testing and work is expected to be put here regarding anything Elsa Voice (during its initial phase).

## [UPDATED] Suggested structure

Because we will be working with different packages at different times during development. A suggested way would be by creating different environments
for different folders. The virtual environment must be named by the name of the folder followed by `-env`. Each folder must have `requirements.txt`.  

#### For instance:

When wanting to enter the workspace for the `figuring-it-out` folder, you will need to create and activate the virtual environment name `figuring-it-out-env`. (instructions are in the `figuring-it-out` directory)

At that point, you can make any installations within the directory (`pip install ...`), and proceed with anything else

## Make sure you the newly created env to `.gitignore`
